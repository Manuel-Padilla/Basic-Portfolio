        <p>Hello! Thank you for visiting my portfolio page. My name is Manuel Padilla and I'm a student with Houston Coding BootCamp powered by UT at Austin. I am really excited to be part of this cohort. To be able to show case the work I've done in six months is hard work but the reward is worth the effort.</p>

        <p>I enjoy learning new technologies and would like to apply those skills in projects that benefit others.</p>

        <p>In the portfolio section you'll be able to browser through the projects I've created while as a student in my boot camp. If you'd like to contact me regarding my work, please feel free to contact me. You can reach me by clicking on the contact tab and from there you will be able to send me an email. Have a great day!</p>

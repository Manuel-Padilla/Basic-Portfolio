        <p>Hello and thank you for visiting my portfolio page. My name is Manuel Padilla and I'm a student at <a href="https://houston.codingbootcamp.utexas.edu/" alt="Houston Coding Boot Camp UT Austin website" target="_blank"><span id="school">The Houston Coding Boot Camp Delivered by UT Austin.</span></a> I am really excited to be part of this cohort and am prepared to gain so much full stack web developmental knowledge. I am also excited and looking forward to showcasing the work I've created in a six month span. It's going to be hard work but the reward is well worth the effort.</p>

        <p>I enjoy reading about and practicing new technologies. I hope to work with a group of experienced developers and gain maturity, patience and practice from their knowledge in the field. Then, I aspire to apply those learned skills in projects that benefit others.</p>

        <p>How to navigate through the site is <span id="easy">as easy as 1, 2, 3</span>, simply click on the links at the top right. In the portfolio section you'll be able to browse through projects I've created while in boot camp. You are more than welcome to contact me if you have any questions about my self and my craft. You can easily reach me by clicking on the contact tab and from there you will be able to send me an email.</p>
        
        <p>Make it a great day or not the choice is yours!</p>
